# README

DESCRIPTION: This project aims to predict the rental price of an Airbnb based on a set of features. A significant part of the work involves converting textual features into information usable by a machine learning algorithm.

This project was done for the course "Data Analysis" in my 3rd year of engineering school at ESILV. The dataset was provided by the teacher and can be found in the data folder.

My work is in the notebook `airbnb.ipynb`. The notebook is divided into 4 parts:
- Data exploration & cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Analysis, prediction and submission

Project was done in pair with [Celia Bedel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbedel/)
